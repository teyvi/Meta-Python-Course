 #a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in a double or a single quote

#single line string
single_line_string = "Hello You!"

#Multiline string can be achieved with a backslash
multi_string = 'Hello are you '\
'in the house?'

print(single_line_string + multi_string)
#strings can also be reassigned well, just like all variables except tuples i think haha!
name = "mercy"
print(name)
name = "Angelo"
print(name)

#accessing characters in a string because it is essentially and array. 

print(name[2])
