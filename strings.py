 #a string is a sequence of characters eclosed in a double or a single quote

#single line string
first_string = "Hello You!"

#Multiline string can be achieved with a backslash
multi_string = 'Hello are you '\
'in the house?'

#strings can also be reassigned well, just like all variables except tuples i think haha!
name = "mercy"
print(name)
name = "Angelo"
print(name)
